# iOS on Pixel 4 (flame) - working notes

Port of [ios-sweet](https://github.com/dipa-studio/ios-sweet) (XNU xnu-8796 + iPhone X iOS 16.7.16 userland on
a Redmi Note 10 Pro, SM7150) to the Pixel 4 (`flame`, SM8150). Read `docs/ios-sweet/NOTES.md`
for the history of ios-sweet's kernel patches (0001-0081); this file records what differs on flame.

What works now is in [README.md](README.md). [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) is the engineering log, newest
first: every boot, what broke and why. Paths under `work/`, `logs/`, `backup/`, `dtb/`, `stock/`,
`downloads/`, `images/` and `research/` in either file are local and not in git (see the README).

## Test loop (no buttons, no screen)

1. Phone in fastboot (`adb reboot bootloader` from TWRP).
2. `fastboot boot shim/out/shim-boot.img` (shim alone = probe; with a payload = XNU).
3. The shim sets the PM8150 PON reason to bootloader, so a reset lands in fastboot.
4. `fastboot boot downloads/twrp/twrp-3.7.1_12-0-flame.img`, then
   `tools/flame-log-pull.sh shim logs/X.txt` (and `xnu` for the XNU ring).
- `boot_a` holds TWRP (flashed 2026-10-19) so any reset without the PON reason boots TWRP
  (adb root), not Android. `boot_b` is stock. Restore everything with `images/.../flash-all.sh`.
- macOS asks "Allow accessory to connect?" the first time a new USB identity appears; until
  then `ioreg -p IOUSB` shows the phone `!registered`.

## Google ABL boot image rules (found the hard way)

`fastboot boot` fails with "Error verifying the received boot.img: ..." unless:
- the kernel is **LZ4 (frame) compressed** (uncompressed -> `Unsupported`),
- the Image header has **text_offset 0x80000** (0 -> `Invalid Parameter`),
- the image has an **AVB hash footer** (unsigned, algorithm NONE, padded to 64 MiB),
  `avbtool add_hash_footer --partition_size 67108864 --partition_name boot`.
Header v2, base 0, kernel 0x8000, ramdisk 0x1000000, tags 0x100, dtb 0x1f00000, page 4096,
stock `dtb` (two SM8150 base DTBs; ABL picks v2 and applies dtbo idx 11).
ABL loads the kernel at 0x80080000, the DTB at 0x84500000, the ramdisk at 0x84700000
(TWRP's 30 MB ramdisk went to 0xc0000000). max-download-size 256 MiB.

## Hardware facts (live FDT `dtb/live.dtb` + shim probe)

| Reboot reason | PM8150 PON SOFT_RB_SPARE 0x88f bits [7:1] = 2 (bootloader) -> fastboot; Linux clears it to 0 before every reset; 0x10 (= WDT) at boot | IMEM ignored |

| ramoops | 0xa47ff000 (2 MB), alt 0xa49ff000 (TWRP /dev/access-ramoops) | |

DRAM partly survives resets (shim saw TWRP's kernel pointers at 0x100000000), but a marker
written to the alt ramoops region via /dev/access-ramoops did not survive reboot -> bootloader -> TWRP.

## Layout

- `shim/` flame shim (`build.sh`, Homebrew llvm + lld), `tools/` host tools, `phone/` code that runs in
  iOS on the phone (each directory has a `build.sh`; they use `work/userland/bin/ios-cc`)
- `xnu/patches/` ios-sweet 0001-0081 + flame patches from 0082
- `work/dxb/` blacktop darwin-xnu-build checkout; `work/dxb/xnu` is a git repo whose HEAD is
  "baseline + applied patches", new patches come from `git diff`
- Not for git: `backup/` (partition dumps, serials), `dtb/`, `stock/`, `downloads/` (TWRP,
  IPSW parts, AOSP tools), `work/`, `logs/`

## Flame patches

- 0082 IORPC.kernelContent: Xcode 16+ iig emits it; field added (kernel only) and set at the
  two user->kernel IOUserServer dispatch sites, as in newer XNU.
- 0083 flame basics: early console on the 0x9c400000 / 2280-row framebuffer (SWEET.h
  constants used by start.s, sweet_early.c, arm_vm_init.c), vol+ on PM8150 GPIO6, the Redmi
  touch driver off by default (sweettouch=1 forces it; it would vote L11C to 3.2 V), APSS
  watchdog keepalive in SweetPlatformExpert (flamewdt=0 off, flamereboot=N stop after N s).
- 0084 early framebuffer block mapped Device-GRE, not Normal-NC (no speculative reads into pil_slpi).
- 0085 ST FTS touch (ftm5) over GENI SPI; 0086 its HW clock gating + cpufreq for all 8 cores.
- 0087 fixed-rate vsync + fps stats. 0088 flame USB offsets.
- 0089 log timestamps, RAM mirror of the console ring, poke scripts; with 0090: USB through the apps SMMU
  the way ABL does it (own context bank, translation off) and the UDP command server.
- 0091 USB ARP fixes, TCP file server, `sync` command (0092-0093 included).
- 0094 /dev/pmem (physical memory and SCM calls for userland drivers), file server READ.
- 0095 the A640 core in the kernel, GPU present (frames scaled to fit by the GPU).
- 0096 SweetAccelerator (IOAcceleratorES for Metal, `sweetmtl=1`); 0097 its user client.
- 0098 panic logs into the persistent log ring. 0099 PM8150 RTC time of day (`sweetrtcoff`).
- 0100 clonefile copy fallback on HFS, tap/swipe commands (0101 included).
- 0102 RPMh ARC/VRM votes from userland (PMEM_RPMH). 0103 AMFI stand-in answers trust cache queries.
- 0104 planar IOSurfaces report summed bytes-per-row/element (blank Safari pages).
- 0105-0109 GPU: VA reuse, more page tables, perf vote (`sweetgpufreq`), recovery, async submit.
- 0110-0112 Apple continuous display corners (final: 0112, GPU scissored bands + CPU row masks).
- 0113 wait for a client's last fence before unmapping its memory.
- 0114 the AMFI policy answers dyld's policy query: @rpath frameworks of third-party apps load.
- 0115 v2 GPU user client (NativeAdreno ABI) for Turnip: GPU buffers from RAM XNU does not manage
  (no cacheable physmap alias), multi-IB submits, progress-based hang detection.
- 0116 `sweetmtl=2` selects SweetMetal2 (metal2vulkan + Turnip). 0117-0118 pool accounting, submit timing.
- 0119 present not waited for. 0120 per-process GPU stats, BCM (bus/DDR) votes over PMEM_RPMH.
- 0121 vsync notifications carry the refresh period (CA's frame deadlines were always past).
- 0122 DDR + memory NoC voted up at GPU start (`sweetddr`), GPU pool caps (`sweetgpucap`, `sweetgpureserve`).
- 0123 en0 + Apple80211 for wifid (ios-topaz 0900 + 0128, from HackiOS), the station over /dev/wlan to
  wland in userland.
- 0124 10-bit surfaces as BGRA only for WebContent (`sweetsurf10`); the joined network keeps its scan record.
